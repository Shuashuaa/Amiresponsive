## What(s) new? ✨

#### Unlike version 1, in version 2 I still used Vue.js 3 but with TypeScript, Vite, and TailwindCSS in replacement of Vuetify3. <br> The application size (gzipped) was reduced from <code style="font-size: 30px; color: orange;">***154.82kb***</code> to <code style="font-size: 30px; color: yellow;">***56.63kb***</code> minified as twice!.

- [x] Vuejs3 =>  <b style="text-decoration: underline;">Vuejs3 TypeScript</b>
- [x] Vite
- [x] Vuetify3 =>  <b style="text-decoration: underline;">TailwindCSS</b>
- [ ] Output can be downloaded as png
- [x] Can now output both global (https) and local (http) systems
- [x] New user interface
- [x] Minified and made faster using TailwindCSS

## Future Features ⏳

- [ ] users can create an account
- [ ] users created an account can save their outputs via limited inventory

## Why?

As a front-end developer, hypotetically for most websites the responsiveness takes up 90%-ish of the whole project if (implemented for multiple devices). Imagine creating a full-stack app where all the functions are set up, the backend and database is finished, and the trial is on Monday. Now, imagine reading this and realizing that your website isn't yet responsive.
